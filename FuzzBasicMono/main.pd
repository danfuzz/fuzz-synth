#X text 6 133 Note: The `voice` object is set up to receive named messages
to set parameters (frequency and velocity) and to turn on and off \,
as opposed to more directly taking note data. This seems to be a departure
from many Pd / Organelle patches \, but strikes me (@danfuzz) as a
reasonable tactic \, and one that is straightforwardly extensible for
handling both richer input as well as nontrivial voice configuration.
