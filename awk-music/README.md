awk-music
=========

This is a port of Kyle Keen's generative piece "AWK Music" to the Organelle.
Find the original at <http://kmkeen.com/awk-music/>.

**Note:** This is not a translation of the piece to PureData. It uses the
original AWK code, running it with `awk` per se on the Organelle.

### How to build

The script `scripts/build-organelle` builds an install file for the Organelle.
